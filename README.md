# Instabug Backend Challenge 2022 

## To run the code  

``` 
docker-compose up --build
```
### Take into consideration
> :warning: :exclamation: At the beginning you will find errors related to workers, they vanish once rabbitmq is working and it only takes few seconds, so please wait till rabbitmq and app are working before testing. I really tried hard to manage the errors and I will fix them later. :warning: :exclamation:

## Assumptions and notes: 

- The application is containerized using **docker**. 
- **Redis**:
    - To get number of chats from a certain application, increment it, and assigned it to a newly created chat 
    - To get number of messages from a certain chat, increment it, and assigned it to a newly created message 
    
  **using ` incr ` command from redis.**
 - **Rabbitmq & Sneakers**: 
   - To have a queue for inserting the messages and chats requests into the database.
- **Rufus scheduler**:
    - To update `chat_count` and `message_count` every `20 mins`
## Race condition:
So since that `message_number` and `chat_number` are generated by the system, to handle race condition I used ` incr ` command from redis ` as it is an atomic function thus only one instance can access it at a time.

## Endpoints: 
- You can list all endpoints by `http://localhost:3000/routes` after making sure that docker is up.
```
GET   /applications/
GET   /applications/{access_token}
GET   /applications/{access_token}/chats
GET   /applications/{access_token}/chats/{chat_number}
GET   /applications/{access_token}/chats/{chat_number}/messages
GET   /applications/{access_token}/chats/{chat_number}/messages/{message_number}
GET   /applications/{access_token}/chats/{chat_number}/messages/search?text={text}

POST  /applications  - body of request {"name": {application_name}}
POST  /applications/{access_token}/chats/
POST  /applications/{access_token}/chats/{chat_number}/messages - body of request {"body": {message_body}}

PUT   /applications/{access_token} - body of request {"name": {application_name}}
PUT   /applications/{access_token}/chats/{chat_number}/messages/{message_number}  - body of request {"body": {message_body}}

```
